    <h3 class="casestudy-title">Overview</h3>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            Created as a personal portfolio website to display work to potential clients and recruiters, pixelblue.io is built using a combination of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, utilizing the jQuery library. As a "living" webpage, the intent is to continually update and improve this portfolio with new labs, jobs, and projects that undergo development. Heavy emphasis is placed on clean minimalistic style, interactive design, and the feeling of “flow” to the webpage.
        </p>
    <h3 class="casestudy-title">Research</h3>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            The first steps taken towards the creation of this webpage were learning the languages that would be used. Prior to this project, I had no experience programming in HTML5, CSS3, or JavaScript. To me, a portfolio is one of your most important assets, and I wanted to be able to own every part of mine rather than use some form of cookie-cutter template.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            Once I was more familiar with the code that I would need to write, I began researching responsive web design and options that were available to me to ensure smooth desktop and mobile performance. This led me to learning about different frameworks, primarily Bootstrap and Foundation. While I did not use a framework on this webpage, many “responsive grid” techniques used were found by reading documentation of common frameworks and “boilerplates”.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            Final research was done to decide the most necessary content to display on a portfolio of this nature, and to make that information readily available to any visitors.
        </p>
    <h3 class="casestudy-title">Design</h3>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            Initial design started with rough sketches of a general layout. Based on research done I settled on a single page design to have all information available in one place, and to make displayed work the centerpiece. The single page design was also an attempt to streamline the initial creation of the site.
        </p>
        <div class="casestudy-image"><a title="Design Sketches" target="_blank" href="res/images/work/casestudy/block2/pixelblue.io-design_sketches.png"><img src="res/images/work/casestudy/block2/pixelblue.io-design_sketches.png"></a></div>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            After what I have since dubbed an “alpha prototype” the design stayed very similar but the style for the website changed drastically. This was the point where I wanted to emphasize a very clean minimalistic style for the webpage.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            The following prototype was sticking to the original layout more but was using the new design style that I had created. It was a step in the right direction, but something about the whole flow of the webpage was still not sitting well with me. I resolved this feeling in the last iteration of the webpage layout. By making all content visible on the main page a display of work, I was able to create an overlay of information for whatever the user wanted to view.
        </p>
    <h3 id="casestudy-title">Prototyping</h3>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            The “alpha prototype” was used to get the basic structure for the webpage viewable in HTML. It was also reflecting the first design style, which was modified for the next iteration. Being the first webpage I constructed using these programming languages, it was a huge learning experience for me.
        </p>
        <div class="casestudy-image"><a id="prototype-img-link" title="Prototype Variants" target="_blank" href="res/images/work/casestudy/block2/pixelblue.io-prototypes_a.png"><img id="prototype-img" src="res/images/work/casestudy/block2/pixelblue.io-prototypes_a.png"></a></div>
        <script>
            setInterval(function(){
                if($("#prototype-img").attr("src") == "res/images/work/casestudy/block2/pixelblue.io-prototypes_a.png"){
                    $("#prototype-img").attr("src", "res/images/work/casestudy/block2/pixelblue.io-prototypes_b.png");
                    $("#prototype-img-link").attr("href", "res/images/work/casestudy/block2/pixelblue.io-prototypes_b.png");
                } else {
                    $("#prototype-img").attr("src", "res/images/work/casestudy/block2/pixelblue.io-prototypes_a.png");
                    $("#prototype-img-link").attr("href", "res/images/work/casestudy/block2/pixelblue.io-prototypes_a.png");
                }
            }, 3000);
        </script>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            The first version of the restructure was dubbed “v1.0.beta-0”, and featured the new style direction and completely single page navigation. This was a step in a good direction, and information for projects was being displayed as an overlay on the work section of the page. However, after finishing the prototype for the second design it still seemed too unstructured and didn’t have a good feeling of “flow”.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            The final prototype and the version this case study is on, implemented an information overlay that loaded the information for whichever link was clicked on by the user. This slimmed down the single page design to be able to display only work to the viewer immediately, and any other information was easily accessible and cleanly placed over the page content in a separate container.
        </p>
    <h3 class="casestudy-title">Final Notes</h3>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            Being the first web project I have ever worked on, it has been an incredible learning experience in regards to both the web development and design process. Most challenges stemmed from lack of knowledge to perform certain techniques so I found myself doing research consistently throughout this project. I have also gone back and restructured/renamed code very often, and each iteration has made it much easier to work with, modify, and create content.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            I look forward to taking the skills I learned throughout this project and strengthening them with work to come.
        </p>
