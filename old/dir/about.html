    <h3>Hello World! My name is David Raymond.</h3>
    <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
        I am a developer and junior designer, avid pixel artist, and a senior at Plymouth State University!
    </p>
    <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
        As a continual learner, I work on improving my skills as an independent developer in my spare time to be able to approach any problem I may come across confidently.
    </p>
    <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
        HUGE outdoor enthusiast. Snow-sports, hiking, and cliff activities are some of my favorite pastimes. I satisfy a large amount of my adrenaline cravings during the winter as a professional Snowboard Instructor at Waterville Valley Resort in northern New Hampshire.
    </p>
    <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
        The 2017-2018 year represents my final year studying towards my BS in Information Technology. While the vastness ahead is frightful, I have been highly anticipating its arrival and look forward to where the winds direct me post-graduation.

    <h3>What is Pixel <span style="color:#0099FF">Blue</span>?</h3>
    <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
        Originally intended only as an online alias, Pixel Blue was created as a brand for business, publishing, and personal work. The creation of this brand and this webpage sparked a passion for web development and design that was absent prior to.
    </p>
    <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
        My hope is to have Pixel Blue represent a clean, minimal style of design while having a very interactive, almost gamified, user experience. Information should be readily available in a very easy to read way, but also engaging to users.
    </p>
    <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
        To me, it represents a next step towards starting my career post-graduation with a strong presence in the developer community. It also gives me a firm platform to publish personal projects the first of which is under heavy prototyping at this time.
