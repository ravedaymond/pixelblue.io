    <h3 class="casestudy-title">Overview</h3>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            This was the first "official" graphics job I had done, and I ended up very happy with the outcome. After a brief discussion about what the client was looking for in a logo, I asked for any relating materials that they had drafted up. Not much research was done as the first draft I came up with was turned into the final product, with a few different color palettes for variety.
        </p>
    <h3 class="casestudy-title">Design</h3>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            For the design, I immediately had an idea of a final product after talking with Nick. I was given a headshot of the main character for the web comic he is working on, and I figured that’d be a great way to advertise the story at its infant stage.
        </p>

        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            Nick talked passionately about the universe he was working on creating for his web comic, and it pulled me in right away. I’m a sucker for a good story, and this kind of creative work is something I thoroughly enjoy.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            After describing small pieces of the conflict and main characters’ home, I got to work on the logo. Not much time was spent on drafting, as I jumped right into the creation of what eventually became the final product. As such, I spent more time looking for a few complimentary gradients that would work well with the logo.

    <h3 class="casestudy-title">Final Notes</h3>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            I already had a font style saved that I felt would fit perfectly with the sci-fi setting that Nick was shooting for. I also added a skyline for his upcoming setting in a fade background for the character, which I beleived would help set the feel of the design. After getting his approval, I packed up the final logo and sent it on its way. This was a great job experience for working with vector graphic creation and manipulation.

    <h3 class="casestudy-title">Testimonial</h3>
        <p class="casestudy-paragraph">
            "Within the same day he had sent me a message back showing me a concept of the logo he had thought of and I was very impressed. It was clean and simple. I was very happy with the quality of the [finished] logo and the time in which it was given to me." -Nick Willette
